This repository contains the Chatterbox server, built on top of <a href="http://postrank-labs.github.com/goliath/doc/index.html">Goliath</a> for Ruby. For now, there exists a single executable: `dev.' I'm building a test harness under <a href="http://www.tavendo.de/autobahn/doc/python/">Autobahn</a> for Python, which will eventually yield a `test' executable. A production executable lies outside the scope of this project, however, but RSpec tests should include a few integration archetypes.
